# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – Basics

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model mainly used for image-related tasks such as image classification, object detection, and OCR. Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs can automatically learn important visual features like edges, textures, and shapes directly from images.

CNNs work by applying small filters (kernels) that slide over an image to extract local patterns while preserving spatial information. This makes them efficient and powerful for visual data. By using shared weights and fewer parameters, CNNs reduce complexity and perform better than fully connected networks on image data.
